 1/3 a cup of water

 Salt to taste 

Any good cooking Oil 
","Get a pot of water going on medium heat (you want this to start to boil when ready to steam your yam flour mix) 
Sieve your flour to get rid of any unwanted debris (the flour I used was milled in a public mill used of groundnuts, corn etc. so it’s inevitable that some of these residues may be in it) 
Pour the sieved yam flour into a big bowl and gradually add water in. You want to mix it thoroughly in circular motion aiming for the flour and water mixture to turn into small grains like couscous. Don’t be heavy on the water but if you are, you can adjust with flour. Be patient because this can take up to 10 minutes. To speed up the process, you can shake the bowl so be patient and crack on till you get that texture 
Get the second part of your steamer on the boiling water and pour the mixture in and cover it for 15 minutes, staring gentle after the first 10 minutes
After 15 minutes, take it off the fire and rinse in cold water to allow any unwanted particles that may still be in to come to the surface, and also to take any bitterness that yam can sometimes have. The water also helps to break any clumps that may have formed. You may have to wash it twice 
 Let it drain for a few minutes and then add 3 teaspoons of oil, salt to taste and mix 
 Get the mixture back into the steam pot/colander and back on the boiling pot of water 
To keep the steam in, you can put a clean kitchen cloth/ parchment paper over the pot before covering. After another 10 – 12 minutes, your wasawasa is ready to be taken off the fire and into a serving dish
Serve with shito and all the trimmings you want (spaghetti, cooked black eyed-beans, chopped lettuce/ cabbage, onions etc. and any protein choice! "

The longer, the better.After it’s marinated to your satisfaction, transfer the chicken into a cooking pot, place on a hob on low heat add some chopped onions and salt to taste, leave to simmer for 15 minutes. Do not add water. This process allows the chicken to release its own juices.,stir occasionally….After 15 minutes, add 1-2 cups of water, taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary, let this slowly cook till tender…The chicken shouldn’t be too soft, just tender so it’s easy to shred as it will be cooked further with the carrots and potatoes…When it’s tender, take out the chicken and shred into small pieces…When the onions are fragrant, add the minced chicken if you’re using any, fry till the mince loses its pinkness….(Skip this step if you’re using just shredded chicken).Now add the shredded chicken, stir for a minute…..Now, add the carrots and potatoes. ..Also add 1 knorr cube, remaining garlic powder and curry powder, chicken seasoning, also add the thyme and salt to taste…

Once the yam is almost fully cooked, stir in the grated pepper and palm oil.

Continue to cook the mixture for a few more minutes until the yam is completely soft and the flavors have melded together.

Yam Giz dodo ,"
1/2 of a Small Yam

Vegetable oil

2 Ripe Plantains

1 Red, Yellow and Green Sweet Peppers

2Red Bell Peppers

1/2 Can Plum or 3 Medium Tomatoes

2 Onions

1 Scotch Bonnet

2 Bouillon Cubes

1 Teaspoon Curry Powder

1Teaspoon Dried Thyme

Salt to Taste","Blend the whole red bell peppers, tomatoes, scotch bonnet and one onion till smooth or semi smooth and set aside…
Chop the sweet peppers and one onion and set aside…
Chop the Yam into big size pieces, add 4-5 tablespoons of water, season with one Bouillon cube and set aside..
Clean and chop the Gizzard into bite size pieces, season with salt, one Bouillon cube, onions, Thyme and Curry powder, cook till soft..
When the Gizzard is well cooked, fry till golden brown…Chop the Plantain into bite size pieces, then fry till golden brown. Set aside.
I fry the Plantain and Gizzard in a deep fryer but I prefer to fry Yam on the hob for safety reasons, for Yam to properly cook, water has to be added to the oil. If/When  water is added to the oil, the water cooks the Yam before the frying process begins. To avoid any fire hazard,  I figure it’s safer to do this on a hob.
Now, place a saucepan on medium heat, then add vegetable oil. Make sure the heat isn’t too high. When it’s moderately hot, add the chopped Yam along with the water into the oil. Be careful when doing this cos you really don’t want to start a fire in your kitchen. Alternatively, you can remove the pan from the hob/fire before adding the Yam.
Fry till it’s well cooked. This should take 5-6 minutes. Leave to drain in a colander.
For the sauce, Pour 1.5 cooking spoon vegetable oil into a wok or deep pan, place on medium heat. When the oil is hot, add chopped onions, saute till translucent, then add the blended peppers, Thyme, curry powder, one Bouillon cube and salt to taste. Fry for 10-12 minutes. Be sure to stir every now and then to prevent burning..
After 10-13 minutes, add the chopped peppers and fry for a further 3 minutes…
Then, add the fried Gizzard, then the fried Yam, stir and combine. Leave to cook for 2 minutes…
Then, add the fried Plantain, cook for a minute. Don’t cook for too long to avoid the Plantain becoming soggy.
